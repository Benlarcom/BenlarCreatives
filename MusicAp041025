MusicApp | BenlarCreatives
Overview

MusicApp is an engaging, user-friendly web application designed by BenlarCreatives.
It allows users to register and submit song requests that can later be integrated with popular streaming platforms like YouTube Music, Spotify, and Apple Music.
This application would be perfect for an indoor setup or fun event with family and friends. Allowing each person attending the organized event to have a shared responsibility to play their kind of music and enjoy the setup as well.

The project consists of two main webpages styled with a unified stylesheet.
